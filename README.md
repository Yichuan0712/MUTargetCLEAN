# MUTarget + CLEAN

1. Can I simply add 3 losses together? 

    Don't do it, temporarily applying a small weight to the SupCon loss to mitigate gradient explosion


2. How to improve distance map efficiency?

    hardmine() is much slower now, infer time is way too big with an updating esm


3. Evaluate & test?
